        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr">Successfully prizing the chocolate from the decaying hand, clasping it deep in your hand you quickly gather your bag and exit through the gate and leaving the shadow of the house behind. 
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr">Holding tight to your prize, you look to see the glory of your strange endeavour unfurling your fingers slowly you glance down toward the sphere encased in an orange jacket. Pulling each side, you watch as the ball rotates before your eyes and drops in your hand. Free from its wrapper you plunge the chocolate deep into your mouth. –your jaw stops, your eyes widen. Your hand races to return to your mouth- catching the ball as your mouth rejects the sphere.<br> 
          “Eurgh!” you shout in disgust, “Who on earth gives coffee flavoured chocolate to kids?” 
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr">Your arm shoots violently to the side sending the chocolate streaking through the grey air… You watch as it begins to drop, following it as it loses height and shatters against the cold stone beyond the perimeter fence of the town cemetery. The coffee core oozes down the stone toward the ground below. Your arm shoots violently to the side sending the chocolate streaking through the grey air… You watch as it begins to drop, following it as it loses height and shatters against the cold stone beyond the perimeter fence of the town cemetery.

        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr">Continuing on you make your way through the moonlit darkness on to the next victim of your night. Arriving at house the second house engulfed by the fog.<br>
          You enter the grounds discovering a garden strewn with caskets, coffins and chests.<br>
          This doesn’t feel like a normal night of trick or treating is coming.
