        While some are rich, Others are needy, <br />
        Some are humble. others are greedy. <br />
        Wicked candy waits, in a ghastly magic bowl, <br />
        Guarded by Ghouls from a deep dark Hole. <br />
        What is the perfect number, count with each breath, <br />
        Too little, or too much, might just mean your death... <br />

            Well, dear Mortal, you have two hands but one simple brain. Each of
            your hands can grab up to 10 sweets if you are lucky, but the amount
            I allow you to take is a secret.
          </p>
          <p>
            The total amount of sweets you can play for with each grab is the
            same as the answer to this puzzle. Can you work it out?
