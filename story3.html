          Turning you leave the shadow of the house and make you way through the gate.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr">Holding tight to your prize, you look to see the glory of your endeavour unfurling your fingers slowly you glance down toward the sphere encased in an orange jacket. Pulling each side, you watch as the ball rotates before your eyes and drops in your hand. Free from its wrapper you plunge the chocolate deep into your mouth.<br>
          Your jaw stops. Your eyes widen.<br>
          Your hand races to return to your mouth- catching the ball as your mouth rejects the sphere.<br>
          “Eurgh!” You shout in disgust, “Who on earth gives coffee flavoured chocolate to kids?” <br>
          Your arm shoots violently to the side sending the chocolate streaking through the grey air. You watch as it begins to drop, following it as it loses height and shatters against the cold stone beyond the perimeter fence of the town cemetery. The coffee core oozes down the stone toward the ground below. <br>
          Continuing you make your way through the moonlit darkness on to the net victim of your night. Arriving at house number 3 you cautiously climb the steps one by one.
