        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr">Leaving the chaos of the house behind you, stuffing the chocolate into your bag you leave, passing through the gate and return to the street.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr"> A strange smell lurks beneath your nose, the stench of rotting meat unmissable and inescapable, but there’s something different there. A bitter scent mixed with a sweet tone a hint of chocolate and coffee. Your nose guides your body twisting toward the scent. There before you dragging its crumbling corpse of decaying flesh toward you, a Zombie. 
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr">You watch in awe the body groaning inches toward you. But beyond him, deep the fog the street seems to move, meandering in your direction. Like the parting of the seas the fog clears revealing that our coffee scented friend didn’t come alone- he brought some friends for an evening stroll- an army of the undead. 
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr"> They jerk, twitch and flinch forward beginning to close in, arms reaching out slowly as the sound of the groans grow to a crescendo. You clasp your loot and hurriedly move in the opposite direction of the horde. Your walking becomes quicker as your heart races at the thought of what is following. Running you turn left down an alley, turning right at the end as the cacophony of groans fades into the distance. Continuing on you turn right again arriving at a crossroads
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr">Stood breathing deep you stop to take in your surroundings and plan your next move. You came from the left, the right appears to be a dead end, behind you - somehow you see the undead army continue to plod in your direction. But before you see it. A building! Could this be safety?<br>
          You dart toward the building through the gates slamming them behind you
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr"> You dart toward the house through the gates slamming shut behind you allowing you to temporarily escaping the horde. The army of undead safely behind the fences of the house -You turn to find a variety of weapons left behind... It might be time use one.
