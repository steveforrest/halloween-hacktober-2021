## Introduction

This site was created as part of a hackathon programme organised by Code Institute.

Night fell quickly this Halloween. The grey mist crept across the street, silently grasping the senses of sight as the moon glared menacingly above.
The journey ahead is simple go door to door, grab your loot without making trouble.

Gory stories is an interactive halloween story that takes the users on a night of trick or treating with a difference. Solve the puzzles to get the candy, and try to make it home alive!

## UX

### Overview

Gory stories is an interactive tale that takes users through a night of halloween trick or treating. With puzzles and games to complete before progressing to the next pages and getting the candy, who knows it you'll ever make it home!

## User Stories

### Target Audience

The target audience will be children and adults of all ages who enjoy interactive stories and playing games. The theme of the site is halloween so users can expect some spooks and scares but nothing really terrifying. There are some scary sounds playing on some of the pages too.

## Features

### Features Visiable across All Pages

* Navbar - With button to take user back to home page.

* Continue Buttons - Buttons that take the user from page to page within the site.

### Features visable on home page

* Pumpkin Head - This button moves the user onto the first story page. It has animation and sound effects.

* Play/ Pause Button - This stops the video background playing.

* Text - This is an introduction to the site and sets the tone of the games and story. It hints at what the users can expect from the site.

* Background - The video background builds the users excitement and can be paused using the pause button.

### Features visable on story pages

* Text - These story pages walk the user through the tale, linking the puzzle and house pages to give context to the ideas.

* Continue Button - The continue button allows the user to move to the next page once they have finished reading.

### Features visable on puzzle pages

* Instructions - This tells the user how to play the game, and what they need to do to win. Alerts are used to notify the user on whether they've won or lost with buttons to direct thier next move.

* Puzzle - The puzzles need to be completed before moving onto the next page. A modal and/or text-box notifies the user if they need to retry or if they've won and can continue.

* Modals - These pop up on some of the games with retry buttons or continue buttons depending on whether the users passed the game.

* Continue Button - This moves the user onto the next page.

### Future Features

* _Animation_ - Animation to highlight when users lose a game.

### Bugs and Fixes Implemented after Testing 

* _Browser Issues_ - Firefox causes the modals in the games to mis-behave; Unfortunatly we didn't have time to implement a fix.

* _Responsiveness_ - The site doesn't work well on smaller screen sizes; Unfortunatly we didn't have time to implement a fix.

* _Sound Effects_ - Some of the sound effects across the site don't play like they should; Unfortunatly we didn't have time to implement a fix.

* _onclick_ - Add an onclick to the vampire so it disappears when it's clicked within the game; Unfortunatly we didn't have time to implement a fix.

## Testing

### Validation of Code Testing

#### HTML

All Pages tested using [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) HTML Validator.

#### CSS

All Pages tested using [W3C](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) CSS Validator.

#### Javascript

All JS tested using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) Javascript Validator.

## Deployment

This website was developed in Gitpod and hosted on GitHub pages.

### Used Commands during Deployment

1. git add . - To add files to staging area.

2. git commit -m "message here" - To commit the files.

3. git push - To push the committed files to the origin master branch on github.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original 
repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)

2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.

3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Running this Project Locally

To run this code on your local machine, you would go to the respository at
https://github.com/steveforrest/halloween-hacktober-2021 and on the home page on the right hand side just above all the files, you will see a green button that says,
"Clone or download", this button will give you options to clone with HTTPS, open in desktop or download as a zip file.
To continue with cloning, you would;

- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste this URL; https://github.com/steveforrest/halloween-hacktober-2021.git Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
