## Introduction

This site was created as part of a hackathon programme organised by Code Institute.

Night fell quickly this Halloween. The grey mist crept across the street, silently grasping the senses of sight as the moon glared menacingly above.
The journey ahead is simple go door to door, grab your loot without making trouble.

Gory stories is an interactive halloween story that takes the users on a night of trick or treating with a difference. Solve the puzzles to get the candy, and try to make it home alive!

## UX

### Overview

Gory stories is an interactive tale that takes users through a night of halloween trick or treating. With puzzles and games to complete before progressing to the next pages and getting the candy, who knows it you'll ever make it home!  

### Goals

Our goals were to create a halloween inspired story that involved users with games and puzzles in order for them to progress through the tale.
We focused on giving the user a fun and exciting experience, with challenges along the way to keep them enticed.

### Wireframes

We have produced a mock up of the websites pages.
Wireframes created can be found [HERE](./WIREFRAMES.md)

	 * Consistent layout without any confusing elements
     * Have clear feedback for my action taken within the site

2. _Scope Plane_

**Features**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

## User Stories

### Target Audience

The target audience will be children and adults of all ages who enjoy interactive stories and playing games. The theme of the site is halloween so users can expect some spooks and scares but nothing really terrifying. There are some scary sounds playing on some of the pages too.

## Testing

### Validation of Code Testing

#### HTML

All Pages tested using [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) HTML Validator.

#### CSS

All Pages tested using [W3C](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) CSS Validator.

#### Javascript

All JS tested using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) Javascript Validator.

## Deployment

This website was developed in Gitpod and hosted on GitHub pages.

### Used Commands during Deployment

1. git add . - To add files to staging area.

2. git commit -m "message here" - To commit the files.

3. git push - To push the committed files to the origin master branch on github.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original 
repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)

2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.

3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Running this Project Locally

To run this code on your local machine, you would go to the respository at
https://github.com/steveforrest/halloween-hacktober-2021 and on the home page on the right hand side just above all the files, you will see a green button that says,
"Clone or download", this button will give you options to clone with HTTPS, open in desktop or download as a zip file.
To continue with cloning, you would;

- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste this URL; https://github.com/steveforrest/halloween-hacktober-2021.git Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
