        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr">Outside the gate the horde continue to gather, this night is increasingly getting too much to handle. It’s time to escape and quickly too, no amount of candy can correct the terrors so far and a Zombie horde isn’t something to be messed with. 
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr"> Survival is key. A key! You search through your pockets rummaging between wrappers and lint you locate the key for home. 
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr">Silently you sneak round the back of the building and out through the gate. The street before you is silent however that comes to a crushing end as the gate crashes shut behind you… That familiar groan transforms into a roar and the undead army begin their plodding march toward you. 
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr"> Clutching your loot in one hand and key in the other your legs move and your body follows. Suddenly running through the streets, twisting left and turning right ahead of the marching monsters behind you make it to the bottom of the street. There before you Home.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr">Staggering. Gasping. Searching for air you fly toward the safety of home. Freedom from the darkness’ nightmarish adventures. You move closer and closer the door grows larger with each step. The impending relief makes you move quicker… Sanctuary is nearer. Your foot slips and your body crashes to the floor – the key slipping from your grasp. 
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr"> Clambering to the door you stop. Hand on the handle.<br>
          You twist…<br>
          LOCKED! <br>
          The search begins... Find the Key!
