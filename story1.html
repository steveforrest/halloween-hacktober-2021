        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr">Night fell quickly this Halloween. The grey mist crept across the street, silently grasping the senses of sight as the moon glared menacingly above.<br>
          The journey ahead is simple go door to door, grab your loot without making trouble.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr">Striding out you make your way onto the street toward the first house as the fog engulfs your soul. Home already is a distant memory. With each step the sound of your shoes hitting the concrete echo into the darkness. There enwrapped by the fog on the horizon appears the first house. Its size grows as you get closer, you can see its darkened windows obscured by the cold steel bars of the gates become clearer.  You push past the bars arms ready to receive your bounty but…</p>
        <p class="intro-text mid-hdr">Sitting before you discover a severed an arm. It begins to twitch. The elaborate prank convulses again enticing you in. You follow as the fingers jitter and stretch. There appear to be no strings, no mechanisms, nothing that you would normally see with props like this. 
          Abruptly a series of cards materialise before you as a voice cackles,<br>
          “ It’s time to play child, it’s time to play a game!”
